# Bezicne Senzorske Mreze / Wireless Sensor Networks

A college project made on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE. It uses the Arduino device as a controller for a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user holds the device in hand
and controls the game by moving his hand Up, Down, Right and Left, with each movement being tied to a certian action.

## Runing the code

The code was writted and ran using VS Code with the PlatformIO extension. The code is already setup to run on an Arduino microcontroller, therefore you have to connect one
to your PC/laptop/... and upload the code to the microcontroller.

  *Firstly build and compile the code by clicking the checkmark button at the bottom left of your VS Code interface.
  *Then, click on the arrow button next to it to upload the code to your Arduino Nano (make sure you have an arduino env selected).
  *Lastly, open the serial monitor ("plug" button on the same toolbar) and your code should be up and running.

To setup the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, you can follow [their official documentation.](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble/).
